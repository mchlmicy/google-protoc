# google-protoc
A quick test Python implementation for Google's Protocol Buffers

More Info &mdash; https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/

Overview
-

This repo works with Google's Python tutorial (https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/pythontutorial). 

I've included Googles written examples with the repo, however this code does not rely on all of that code.

- To setup the project, run ```bash build.sh```

- To run the project, run ```bash run.sh```

The most relevant files in this repo are the ```build.sh```, ```run.sh```, and ```main.py``` files. Skimming these files should give a quick idea of how everything works together.
